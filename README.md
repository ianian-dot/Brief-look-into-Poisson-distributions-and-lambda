# Brief-look-into-Poisson-distributions-and-lambda

See Rmd notebook [here](https://rpubs.com/jojorabbit1/1195564)

* Shape of poisson distribution and how they change as lambda changes
* Seeing how the arg max X value for PMF corresponds to the lambda value
* Seeing how P(X>lambda) changes as lambda increases
